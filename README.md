# Network-Intrusion-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for network intrusion detection using a structured dataset. The dataset is extracted, preprocessed, and analyzed before applying classification models. The goal is to differentiate between normal and potentially malicious network traffic based on various network-related features. The project leverages data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation to enhance detection accuracy.

Data Processing and Model Training
The dataset is loaded from CSV files, and key features such as protocol type, service, and network flags are analyzed. Data cleaning techniques, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, are applied. Various machine learning models, such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, are trained and evaluated for accuracy. Feature engineering techniques are used to optimize model performance.

Evaluation and Results
The trained models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model is selected based on its ability to accurately classify network traffic. This project provides a foundation for automated intrusion detection systems that can enhance cybersecurity by identifying potential threats in real-time.
